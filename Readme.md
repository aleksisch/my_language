# Esoteric programming language 
	This is simple esoteric language, something between python and c++.

## How it work?

### There are three parts of program.

First parts is a translator from my language to my assembler.

Second part is a compile from my assembly language to my binary code. Then you can run this binary code on a simple stack processor. Stack processor is working on a C language. It's model of real cpu.

After it you can convert my binary code to x86-64 binary elf file and run it on real cpu.
